# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
# Leave it in place.
# Make a copy of it (in the same folder) named `paths.json`.
# In that copy, delete these comments (the lines starting with `#`).
# Then customize the `base_system` paths,
# to point to your clones of the the tax.co and tax.co.web repos.
# Don't change the `docker` paths.
#
# PITFALL: This is not valid JSON -- JSON doesn't have comments.
# But the data below models what paths.json should look like.
# It indicates the location of some files -- some on the base system,
# some in the docker container being hosted by the base system.
