For running locally, the scripts in local/ can be used.
The `start` and `stop` scripts can be called *as* scripts;
the `setup` script must be copied and pasted into the shell
(see its header comment for why).

To launch the server for use online instead of locally,
there is as yet no corresponding "online" folder,
but all the commands for doing that can be found in `by-hand.sh`.
